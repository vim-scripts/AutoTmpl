This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2460

The purpose of this script is to automatically load predefined template files
when editing new files.

The templates can contain fields that are dynamically filled in order to customize
them at creation time (e.g. date of creation).

Currently, templates are provided for:
 - C
 - C++
 - C/C++ headers
 - Python
 - Shell scripts
 - Vim plugins

The plugins use some variables that can be defined in your .vimrc:
 - let g:author = "your name"
 - let g:email = "your email"
 - let g:footer = "the footer you want vim to use for your files (e.g. tabstop=4 textwidth=100)"

Please send me an email with any improvements you think are worth.
